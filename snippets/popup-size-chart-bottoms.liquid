        <h3>General Size Guide - Workwear</h3>
        <p>
          We’ve searched high and low for all the very best gear designed 
          specifically to <em>fit females</em>. With multiple brands on 
          offer, sizing is not 100% consistent across all workwear. So 
          we’ve been busy hand measuring every single product, in 
          every size, for it’s <strong><em>exact measurements</em></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So to find these measurements, head back onto the product page, 
          scroll down to the <strong>Size &amp; Fit</strong> info panel 
          and click to open.

          You can either use our expert <strong>Fit Tips</strong> to guide 
          your size choice. Or you might like to compare our <strong>Exact 
          Measurements</strong> with a similar garment that you already 
          know fits you well. Just be sure that your garment is very 
          similar in shape, fabric and fit.
