You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and the compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You can ask a business for your preference of a free repair, replacement or refund, but you are not always entitled to one. For example, the consumer guarantees do not apply if you got what you asked for but simply changed your mind, found it cheaper somewhere else, decided you did not like the purchase or had no use for it. If the item is deemed as having a minor problem, the business can choose to give you a free repair instead of a replacement or refund. When the item has a major problem, you have the right to ask for your choice of a replacement or refund."</i><br><br>This warranty is given by Stacey Head Enterprises Pty Ltd (ABN 50 606 024 980) trading as she wear.
